## Abstract:  
  This is our Graduation Project in Istanbul Şehir University CS department. 
  
  Acoustically expressed emotions can make the communication more efficient between humans and computers. We think that understanding emotions of humans is the next evolutionary step of interaction of one and other. In this project, our team used state-of-the-art models and techniques to analyze human voice signals to extract the features that computers need for understanding the emotions, as we humans do. This development allows all of the current available personal assistants to evolve and perform significantly better than their current version. The final aim of this project is letting computers to build empathy with humans to achieve the highest interaction quality.

## Aim of the project:

  As an individual, we all want someone or something that understands us and see what we are going through or how we feel. From the start of the civilization we humans come together to overcome the problems we have and socialize to make every individual’s life better. From that perspective, our aim arises. The mood of a person may get affected from various things such as weather, time of the day or even the day of the week, likewise life. It keeps on going. We are willing to give a better daily life for individuals to have a good impact on their mood. Our design aims to predict users’ emotions and their response to certain events with the help of previously recorded reactions of users.
